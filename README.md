# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project involves predicting the presence of heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The main steps include:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to understand the dataset and identify key patterns.
2. **Model Training**: Implemented and trained various machine learning models.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluated the performance of each model and selected the best one based on accuracy and other metrics.


## Key Findings
- Insights from the EDA:
  - Distributions of key features
  - Correlations between features
  - Key patterns and anomalies
- Comparison of model performance:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of different models
  - Confusion matrices and ROC curves
- Detailed analysis of the best model:
  - Hyperparameter tuning results
  - Feature importance

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting heart disease and emphasizes the importance of thorough data analysis and model evaluation.

## How to Run
 Clone the repository:
    ```sh
